For this project I decided to use Truffle's React Box as a good starting point.  React is a popular and capable frontend framework and Truffle was covered extensively in this course.

I also decided to inherit from and use Provable as an Oracle.  This was somewhat daunting as I hit solc version problems and out-of-date manuals.
