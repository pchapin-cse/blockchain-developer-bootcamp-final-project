# :wrench: :construction: Testing Provable's Wolfram Alpha Example.

&nbsp;

This repo is to demonstrate how you would set up a Provable smart-contract development environment using Truffle & the Ethereum-Bridge to do most of the heavy lifting for you. Head on over to the `./test` folder to examine the javascript files that thoroughly test the smart-contract, which latter you will find in `./contracts`.

## :page_with_curl:  _Instructions_

**1)** Fire up your favourite console & clone this repo somewhere:

__`❍ git clone https://github.com/provable-things/ethereum-examples.git`__

**2)** Enter this directory & install dependencies:

__`❍ cd ethereum-examples/solidity/truffle-examples/wolfram-alpha && npm install`__

**3)** Launch Truffle:

__`❍ npx truffle develop`__

**4)** Open a _new_ console in the same directory & spool up the ethereum-bridge:

__`❍ npx ethereum-bridge -a 9 -H 127.0.0.1 -p 9545 --dev`__

**5)** Once the bridge is ready & listening, go back to the first console with Truffle running & set the tests going!

__`❍ truffle(develop)> test`__

## :camera: Passing Tests:

```javascript

  Contract: WolframAlpha Example Tests
    ✓ Should have logged a new Provable query
    ✓ Callback should have logged a new temperature measure event (10317ms)
    ✓ Should have saved the new temperature
    ✓ Should revert on second query attempt due to lack of funds (54ms)

  4 passing (11ms)

```
